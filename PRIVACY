We will not, under any circumstances, give out or sell your information (including name and email address) to anyone. Period.

We will also never send you an email unless it is important and directly related to your Smooth Gestures Plus experience.

The Smooth Gestures Plus software will never send your browsing history or website credentials to another computer system.

From time to time, a programmer will have to access the code in order to update the system, perform routine maintenance, and possibly fix bugs. However, all your data will still remain 100% confidential.

It's possible that we will be required by subpoena or other legal action to grant access to an individual's data in the process of an investigation. However, this has never happened for Smooth Gestures Plus and we don't expect it to.

Please contact scott@smoothgesturesplus.com if you have further questions.
